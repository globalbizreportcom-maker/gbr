                            An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever
                            you're surfing the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP
                            address. globalbizreport.com collects IP addresses for the purposes of system
                            administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the
                            use of our site. When Guests request pages from globalbizreport.com site, our servers
                            log the Guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything
                            personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the
                            user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when
                            we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service
                            or to protect our service, site, customers, or others.
